# Perceptron Learning Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a classic Perceptron algorithm from scratch in Python, featuring:
- Custom training/test datasets
- Multiple learning rate comparisons (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
- Epoch-by-epoch weight/bias tracking
- Accuracy and Mean Squared Error (MSE) evaluation

## Key Features
- Pure Python/Numpy implementation
- Step-by-step training visualization
- Binary classification with threshold activation
- Comparative analysis of learning rates

## Results
Achieved consistent 60% accuracy across all learning rates, with MSE of 0.4

## Usage
1. Clone repository
2. Run `Perceptron.ipynb` notebook
3. View weight evolution and final metrics

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Numpy
